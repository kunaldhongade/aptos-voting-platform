## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
cd voting-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following variables:

```bash
VITE_APP_NETWORK=testnet
VITE_MODULE_ADDRESS=0x635bdbc07d1c2e273d1f2cf27e8c87103928f03a7d4ce1760bd9baa6b784eadc
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5174`.

### 5. Deploy the Smart Contract

To deploy the smart contract:

1.  Install **Aptos CLI**.
2.  Update the **Move.toml** file with your wallet address:

    - Add you Wallet Address from Petra here

    ```bash
    vote_addrx = "0xca10b0176c34f9a8315589ff977645e04497814e9753d21f7d7e7c3d83aa7b57"
    ```

3.  Create your new Address for Deployment

    ```bash
    aptos init
    ```

    - Add your Account addr here for Deployment

    ```bash
    my_addrx = "635bdbc07d1c2e273d1f2cf27e8c87103928f03a7d4ce1760bd9baa6b784eadc"
    ```

4.  Compile and publish the contract:

    ```bash
    aptos move compile
    aptos move publish
    ```
